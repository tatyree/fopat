Most of us working in digital work in a discrete team areas divided up
into individual workspaces where we collect our tools and assignments.
These assignments are organised by 'stories' or 'tickets', which are
stored in an easily accessed ticket management system-Pivotal,
Trello, JIRA, and the like. We like to think we're doing something
progressive, complex, and difficult to manage.

However, let's take a look at another industry that bears a striking
resemblance to ours; workers there work in individual workspaces in a
discrete team area.  They normally organise their work by
tickets-written or printed tickets, but tickets nevertheless. They
estimate (and price) based on complexity and time and they work with
something that is considered one of the pinnacles of human design.  I'm
talking about a bicycle repair workshop. Automotive, aircraft and boat
servicing facilities all operate along similar lines.

And so do you...
